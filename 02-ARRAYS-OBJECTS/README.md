# Analyzing Performance of Arrays and Objects
* **PREREQUISITES**
- Colt's Udemy Section 1: Big O Notation
* [SLIDES](https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/built-in-data-structures-25)

## Section Introduction
* **Built-In Data Structures** --> Through the lens of Big 0
- Analyze the things we do all the time in JS: working with Arrays, Objects, and built-in methods

* **OBJECTIVES**
- Understand how objects and arrays work through the lens of Big O
- Explain why adding elements to the beginning of an array is costly
- Compare and Contrast the runtime for arrays and objects, as well as built in methods (forEach, sort, etc.)

## The BIG O of Objects

## When Are Array's Slow?

## Big O of Array Methods
