# Problem Solving Approach
**Prerequisites**
- Colt's Section 1: BIG O NOTATION 
* [SLIDES](https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/problem-solving-patterns)

## Introduction to Problem Solving
- Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns
#### Objectives
- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and Contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

#### What is An ALGORITHM
- A **process** or **set of steps** to accomplish a certain task
*Examples*
- A set of mathematical steps we need to solve a problem
- Facebook's algorithm that suggests certain ads to you
- Google's search algorithm --> 100 developers working together over 10+ years

#### Why do you need to know this?
- Almost everything you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm
- It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer
- INTERVIEWS

#### How do You Improve?
1. **Devise** a plan for solving problems
2. **Master** common problem solving problems
#### Problem Solving Strategies
- Understand the Problem
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break It Down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back and Refactor
- NOTE: many of these strategies are adapted from **George Polya**, whose book *How to Solve It* is a great resource for anyone who wants to become a better problem solver

## STEP 1: Understand the Problem

## STEP 2: Concrete Examples

## STEP 3: Break It Down

## STEP 4: Solve Or Simplify

## STEP 5: Look Back and Refactor
