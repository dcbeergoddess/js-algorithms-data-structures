# Introduction to Js Algorithms and Data Structures with Colt Steele

- Different from most of Colt's Courses --> Not Exactly Linear
- At Beginning of every Section, there is a text lecture, and article called **Prerequisites** --> Explains the sections that have to be finished before starting the new section

## Big O Notation
- First Technical Section --> **VERY IMPORTANT**
- Come back to it every single section from basically there until the end of the course

## Analyzing Performance of Arrays and Objects 
- Take what was learned in last section on Big O and apply it to some build in data structures that are worked with all the time

## Problem Solving Approach
- interviews, algorithms, coding challenges
- when confronted with a touch problem and you don't know how to solve it
- whiteboard, at home, working on side project or at work --> how to approach a difficult problem

## Problem Solving Patterns
- specific sort of archetypes to your code 
* divide and conquer 
* sliding window frequency
* counter patterns
- CONCRETE PATTERNS

## Recursion 
- comes up later on in many of our algorithms
- two challenge sections --> intermediate and then tougher recursion problems

## Searching Algorithms
- Binary Search

## Sorting Algorithms
### Bubble Sort
### Selection Sort
### Insertion Sort

### Merge Sort
### Quick Sort
### Radix Sort

## Data Structures Introduction
- Second Section of Course
## Singly Linked Lists
### Doubly Linked Lists
### Stacks & Queues
### Binary Search Trees
### Tree Traversal
### Binary Heaps
### Hash Tables

### Graphs
### Graph Traversal 

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
- finding the shortest path between two nodes on a graph, two vertices

## ORDER OF MATERIAL
- Don't have to go through videos in order
- please take your time
- condensed version of bootcamp over 2-3 weeks fulltime
- Prereq Lecture --> info about what other sections you need to complete before jumping in --> with recommended sections to go through

## Running Code
- JS Snippets --> Chrome --> Source in Dev Tools --> Snippets
- Can use Node.Js --> VS Code
- CodePen
